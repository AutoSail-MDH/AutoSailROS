# Signal K Calypso Ultrasonic plugin

> Signal K plugin for connecting to and receiving wind data from a Calypso Ultrasonic wireless wind instrument.

## Requirements
The plugin requires access to the OS' Bluetooth stack. This process differs on the different operating systems. Please refer to: https://github.com/noble/noble#linux. 

After getting all the requirements, make sure that node can access the BT stack. See: https://github.com/noble/noble#running-on-linux. 


## Installation & usage (as Signal K plugin)
Install this plugin using the Signal K app store or install it manually in the Signal K server directory:

```
[sudo] npm install signalk-calypso-ultrasonic
```

After installation, you enable & configure the plugin via the plugins page in the Signal K admin UI.


## Installation & usage (standalone)
It's possible to use this plugin standalone, or as part of another application. Install the plugin using NPM:

```
npm install --save signalk-calypso-ultrasonic
```

After installation, run the factory method and then you can use the `Ultrasonic` class manually:

```javascript
const { Ultrasonic } = require('signalk-calypso-ultrasonic')()

const ultrasonic = new Ultrasonic({
  setRate: 1, // Hz
  setCompass: 1, // Turn on compass/9DOF sensor
  maxRetries: Infinity,
  turnOnHour: 6,
  turnOffHour: 20
})

ultrasonic.on('delta', delta => handleDeltaMessage(delta))
ultrasonic.on('data', data => handleDataMessage(data))
ultrasonic.start()

// Stop searching, disconnect & clean-up
ultrasonic.stop()
ultrasonic.disconnect()
ultrasonic.removeAllListeners()
```

The class accepts the following options:

- `setRate: enum{ false, 1, 4, 8 }`; set an update rate in Hz or leave as is (false)
- `setCompass: enum{ false, 0, 1 }`; set the state of the 9DOF sensor/compass or leave as is (false)
- `maxRetries: Number`; set the number of connection retries (default = `Infinity`)
- `timeout: fn`; a function used to calculate the backoff time (default: `(retries) => (retries / 2) * 500`)
- `name: String{ULTRASONIC}`; the name of the device used to detect the Ultrasonic. Don't change unless you have a different version with a different name.
- `turnOnHour: Number`; hour of the day when the Ultrasonic should wake (default: 7 o'clock)
- `turnOffHour: Number`; hour of the day when the Ultrasonic should go to sleep (default: 20 o'clock)

The class emits the folowing events:

- `deviceInfo`: information about the device state. Values are a envelope object with keys `kind` (name of the characteristic) and `value` (characteristic value)
- `delta`: a Signal K delta message (see below)
- `data`: the decoded data model in intermediate (plain object) format. The model has the following keys: `windSpeedApparent`, `windAngleApparent`, `batteryLevel`, `temperature`, `roll`, `pitch`, `compass`, `timestamp`; where each value is represented in SI units (i.e. Kelvin for temperature, radians for angles and m/s for velocity). Battery level is a float between 0-1.


## Signal K delta output

The Ultrasonic decoder outputs Signal K delta messages. [Read this](http://signalk.org/specification/1.0.4/doc/data_model.html#delta-format) for more info on the delta format. Depending on wether the 9DOF/compass sensor is enabled, the following paths are emitted. Values are, as per the Signal K specification, represented in SI units (i.e. Kelvin for temperature, radians for angles and m/s for velocity). Battery level is a float between 0-1.

- `environment/outside/temperature`
- `environment/wind/angleApparent`
- `environment/wind/speedApparent`
- `electrical/batteries/99/name`
- `electrical/batteries/99/location`
- `electrical/batteries/99/capacity/stateOfCharge`
- `navigation/attitude/roll`
- `navigation/attitude/pitch`
- `navigation/attitude/yaw`
- `navigation/headingMagnetic`

All values/paths are emitted in the `self` context.


## @TODO
- [x] Signal K plugin skeleton + config for writing flags
- [x] Writing flags to the device if they were set in config
- [ ] Figure out if we should be using `environment/wind/angleApparent` or `environment/wind/directionMagnetic` and if we are deriving angle properly ?
- [ ] Figure out how to implement unit tests that don't rely on an actual device
- [ ] Add the configuration option to do combine values with other values in tree to enrich each delta with True Wind and such
